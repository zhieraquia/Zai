  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am currently a Grade 11 student in the STEM strand at Cantilan National High School. I have a strong interest in understanding how students cope with academic challenges, particularly time management and punctuality. My current research focuses on the coping mechanisms of Grade 8 STEM students at CNHS in addressing tardiness.</p>
  <p>My goal is to continue exploring educational psychology and contribute to improving student outcomes. I am also excited to further my studies in fields such as [mention your field of interest, e.g., engineering, technology, or education], with the aim of making a positive impact in both the academic and professional world.</p>
