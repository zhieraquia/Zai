  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>Currently, I am conducting research on the coping mechanisms used by Grade 8 STEM students at Cantilan National High School to address tardiness. This study aims to identify strategies that students employ to manage their time better and improve their punctuality. By understanding these methods, I hope to provide recommendations that can help students improve their academic performance and overall school experience.</p>
  <p>In my research, I am collecting data through Questionnaire, focusing on time management techniques and the challenges students face in terms of punctuality. The findings will offer insights into how schools can support students in overcoming tardiness and enhance their academic success.</p>
